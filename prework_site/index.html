    	<h1>Passion for Outdoor Recreation</h1>

    	<p>Outdoor recreation has always been a passion of mine. As a young child my parents would take my brothers and I camping nearly every month and teach us to appreciate outdoor activities such as hiking and rafting. Prior to attending Turing, and my role as an operations manager, I was able to spend 3 years working in Yosemite National Park. During this time I worked for the the concessionaire of the park helping to facilitate tours and activities as well as promote the preservation of the park to daily visitors. When I was not working I spent time hiking, camping, climbing, and enjoying all the park had to offer.</p>

    	<p>Over the course of this summer after being accepted to Turing and becoming part of the 1808 cohort I was able to take some time to conintue pursue my passion of outdoor recreation. From June to August of this year, my girlfriend and I were able to visit several National Parks. Each park provided a unique experience to get outside. From the high temperatues and sand dunes of Death Valley to the high desert-red cliff environment of Zion National park, all the parks were places that visitors from all over the world visit to spend time admiring. </p>

    	<p>The national parks system and outdoor recreation will continue to be a passion of mine as I am an active member of conservancy projects in several parks around the country. Colorado in particular is one of the best places to continue to enjoy all types of outdoor recreation.</p>
